**Learning:** Found an anti-pattern where `.ToList()` was frequently called before passing `IReadOnlyList<LlmMessage>` into `TokenEstimator.EstimateConversationTokens`, causing unnecessary list allocations and copying, especially during looping and slicing operations (e.g. `Take()`) in hot paths like `AgentLoop` and `CompactionService`.
**Action:** Overloaded `TokenEstimator.EstimateConversationTokens` and `TokenEstimator.CalculateCumulativeTokens` to accept `IEnumerable<LlmMessage>` instead of `IReadOnlyList<LlmMessage>`, preventing the need for `.ToList()` and eliminating the memory allocation bottleneck.

## 2024-05-15 - [Avoid redundant ToList allocations by tweaking return type of internal collection source]
**Learning:** Returning `IReadOnlyList<T>` from a frequently accessed and heavily populated internal method like `SessionManager.RebuildContext()` leads to redundant `Array` allocations downstream when callers unnecessarily cast or copy via `.ToList()`. Because `SessionManager` already builds a `List<T>`, we can directly return `List<T>` and avoid redundant object copies in hot paths like `AgentSession`.
**Action:** When a method builds a `List<T>` internally and is called frequently on performance-sensitive paths (e.g., rebuilding state for the agent loop), evaluate whether you can return `List<T>` directly. However, respect external-facing interfaces to prevent breaking changes.
## 2026-05-06 - Caching stable properties vs properties that allocate on access
**Learning:** Found an anti-pattern in `ToolRuntime.ToToolDefinitions()` where it used LINQ `.Select().ToList()` on a stable, rarely-changed dictionary on every call. Because `ToToolDefinitions()` is called during the hot loop of `AgentLoop`, this resulted in redundant memory allocation on every iteration.
**Action:** When a method returns a collection derived from stable internal state (e.g. converting a Dictionary's values to a DTO list), evaluate doing this conversion once during the object's construction or lazily on first access, instead of calculating it every time the method is called.
