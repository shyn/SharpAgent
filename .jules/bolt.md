**Learning:** Found an anti-pattern where `.ToList()` was frequently called before passing `IReadOnlyList<LlmMessage>` into `TokenEstimator.EstimateConversationTokens`, causing unnecessary list allocations and copying, especially during looping and slicing operations (e.g. `Take()`) in hot paths like `AgentLoop` and `CompactionService`.
**Action:** Overloaded `TokenEstimator.EstimateConversationTokens` and `TokenEstimator.CalculateCumulativeTokens` to accept `IEnumerable<LlmMessage>` instead of `IReadOnlyList<LlmMessage>`, preventing the need for `.ToList()` and eliminating the memory allocation bottleneck.

## 2024-05-15 - [Avoid redundant ToList allocations by tweaking return type of internal collection source]
**Learning:** Returning `IReadOnlyList<T>` from a frequently accessed and heavily populated internal method like `SessionManager.RebuildContext()` leads to redundant `Array` allocations downstream when callers unnecessarily cast or copy via `.ToList()`. Because `SessionManager` already builds a `List<T>`, we can directly return `List<T>` and avoid redundant object copies in hot paths like `AgentSession`.
**Action:** When a method builds a `List<T>` internally and is called frequently on performance-sensitive paths (e.g., rebuilding state for the agent loop), evaluate whether you can return `List<T>` directly. However, respect external-facing interfaces to prevent breaking changes.

## 2025-03-04 - Cache stable collections to avoid hidden recurring list allocations in hot paths
**Learning:** Returning LINQ expressions like `.Select().ToList()` directly from a parameterless method (`ToolRuntime.ToToolDefinitions`) causes hidden O(N) array allocations every time the method is invoked. This was exceptionally problematic when called during `AgentLoop`'s hot path for every request message build.
**Action:** When a collection derived from internal state (like `_toolsByName`) is relatively stable, cache it during construction into an `IReadOnlyList<T>` field and return the cached reference from parameterless methods to eliminate hidden array allocations. Ensure the cache is built after all implicit logic (like duplicate key deduplication via Dictionary populating) has occurred.
